I wonder if [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton) could bring in more filters for your timeline that you can use to turn on and off (in app) such as Emoji so turn all ðŸ“š on / off / integrated etc. Would be nice to see a different approach to lists / search for sure. 

Iâ€™ve gone into the web settings and turned off people you donâ€™t follow mentions option but would be cool to flick them back on perhaps filters are;

solo / hide / intergrate (default)

UI would need to be nice and quick. Been thinking a little about filtering in other contexts maybe an idea ðŸ’¡ 

Also could be good for organsing your own posts and filtering for review / reuse. Note to self need to look how a markdown doc keeps emoji.

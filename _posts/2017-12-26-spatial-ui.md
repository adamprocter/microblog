One of the areas of investigation for my PhD project revolves around spatial user interfaces and connected to this the concept of spatial hypertext. I will be writing in more detail about this however there is little that seems to have advanced in this regard since the mid 2000’s and so I would like to pin down some more current and interesting examples. A key thing is that a spatial interface is not to be confused with a concept map, although there are similarities, a spatial interface is a way to arrange collections of different objects and draw connections between them visually and spatially. I am concerned with a thinking tool to help work out relational information design. Here is a piece on information design I previously [wrote](http://researchnot.es/7_information_design).

Two keys texts are the following;

- Marshall, C.C. & Frank M Shipman, I., 1999.[ Spatial Hypertext: An Alternative to Navigational and Semantic Links](http://cs.brown.edu/memex/ACM%5C_HypertextTestbed/papers/37.html). pp.1–5.
- Bernstein, M., 2013. [Can We Talk about Spatial Hypertext?](http://students.ecs.soton.ac.uk/mwra1g13/msc/comp6045/pdfs/Bernstein%20-%20Can%20We%20Talk%20about%20Spatial%20Hypertext.pdf), pp.1–10.

However what I am keen to gather in the first instance is more examples of spatial interfaces. Here are my starters.

- Aquanet
- [VIKI](http://csdl.tamu.edu/~marshall/viki-sidebar.html)
- [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/)
- [Nuclino](https://www.nuclino.com/) 
- [Graph Commons](https://graphcommons.com/)

Please join the [discussion here](http://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2017/12/26/spatial-ui.html) and post any interesting spatial interfaces.

As an aside, Frode Hegland also undertaking a web science PhD is also undertaking some work in this field with what he calls [liquid views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcs6umMYg9k). This is an interactive way to work with a text document as a researcher.

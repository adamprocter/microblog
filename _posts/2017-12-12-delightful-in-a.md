Long day will record PhD microcast report tomorrow morning. Morning mainly not getting Go Lang blog to [sort](https://play.golang.org/p/bBR8wfcZfb) as I want. Midday awesome chat with @dajbelshaw about MoodleNet. More on that soon hopefully! 😊 and then afternoon mainly on delightful design and what it is and why it’s important not to “Nudge” but to empower. Which was hard going on fact.

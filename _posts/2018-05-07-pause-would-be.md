Sometimes a pause button would be fantastic. There are moments where I just think yes pause please. 

Sitting in the garden, weather is just right, can hear animals everywhere enjoying themselves. One beer buzz in. Kids playing a game together taxing their thinking and laughing together. Wife doing some random DIY (she loves that) and well Iâ€™m doing next to nothing just being in the moment. 

Pause please.

Let’s continue to make it clear there was a club in Milton Keynes called MK City. Yet you didn’t show up for them,their status to lowly for you but when a club in financial crisis was ripped from its fans by greedy business men and placed in your town with a nice new ground paid for by Walmart and Ikea with a league position you suddenly started to turn up and yet you continue to get affronted that we don’t like you?

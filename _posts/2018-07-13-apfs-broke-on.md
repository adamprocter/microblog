Amazing end to my stressful week my MacBook Pro (2016) appears to have corrupted its drive. Edging closer to a full Back Blaze restore nightmare. Finder went mad and disk util said snapshot meta data was invalid. Cleared dateless snap shots. Run disk until in Single users says disk ok. But itâ€™s not. Safe mode now booting. Restore maybe next. Having one of those weeks.

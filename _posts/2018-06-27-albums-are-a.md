My good friend has Spotify & I have Apple Music I have to have the Spotify iOS app to be able to send her links to records I think she would like, this is pretty terrible due to no open options, and no scripts via IFTTT or workflow to do a search and convert are available. But wow recently opening Spotify it is totally confusing if you want to share a record/ LP its all about playlists from what I can tell.

Thankfully Apple Music has not gone down this route. I think the Album is important and the order selected by the Artist is important thatâ€™s how I want to hear my music so please Apple if your doing one thing well in Apple Music it is by ensuring Albums are a thing. Thank you. ðŸŽ§

Totally agree and was only taking about this last week a focus on wages as the measure of University education is fundementally missing the point of University education. 

> [Linda Drew](http://dctr.pro/27r), the vice-chancellor of Ravensbourne - the UK's newest university - warned that using graduate salaries to measure the success of higher education is a "cold, grim way" of looking at it. She argued that the current government emphasis on Stem subjects neglects the fact that many industrial and tech companies value input from the arts and humanities for the new, creative perspectives they bring.

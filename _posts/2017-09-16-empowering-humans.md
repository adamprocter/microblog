As we move towards the inevitably automated world. We must focus on what makes us human. Let the robots be robots. What we have that they can never have, we have the ability to be creative. As educators we need to teach humans to be creative. Let the Tesco's and Amazon robots and drones package and deliver our goods, but let's empower the humans first.

Inspiring talk indeed, Simon Sinek considers the overuse & instant gratification that has arisen from a variety of converging areas, specifically connected to millianials around environment and technology.

Connected is Simons “Start with the Why” book and his excellent [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action) but I’d also say do check out @fehlers book [Start!](http://tinybooks.org/books/start/) for even more inspiration [@fehler](https://micro.blog/fehler) takes it another level down to suggest that you should start with the Who and that the Who drives the Why -  [Tiny Books](http://tinybooks.org) 

👍👍👍

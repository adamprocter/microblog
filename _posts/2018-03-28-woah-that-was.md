WOAH that was major, finally have a very simple example of real time database using [Vue and Cloud FireStore](https://gitlab.adamprocter.co.uk/adamprocter/vue-and-cloud-firestore), only took me a day + ! But thankfully I now am back to where I was a few months back with Deepstream hub... realtime spatial hypertext coming soon(ish)

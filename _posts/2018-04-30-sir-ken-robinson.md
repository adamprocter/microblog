I'm a big fan of the approaches Sir Ken Robinson has been taking to education and his commentary chimes with my own thoughts on Education, what it should be and the state of play. Well he has a new book out entitled [You, Your Child, And School](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Your-Child-School-Navigate-Education/dp/0670016721) 

>This book offers clear principles and practical advice on how to support your child through the K-12 education system, or outside it if you choose to homeschool or un-school

>Real social change tends to come from the ground up anyhow, because thereâ€™s a shift in the culture.

Ill be getting myself a copy for sure.  If you dont know much about Ken his mantra has been 
[Schools are killing creativity](https://inews.co.uk/news/education/creativity-schools-arts-education-sir-ken-robinson/) This article give some background links to his 2006 Ted Talk. Things have certainly cermented his argument since then too.

I have many moments driving or walking where I have a thought in my head and I need to capture is as close to the metal as possible as soon as possible, so a voice recording would be the closest but Hey Siri Record Audio.... nope. You have say Hey Siri new Voice Memo but it still doesnâ€™t auto start recording... hey Siri you are a pain

Turn off Phone?

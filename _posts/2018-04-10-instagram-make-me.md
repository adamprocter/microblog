I get anxious when in real life friends donâ€™t like an Instagram photo of mine, especially if it related to work Iâ€™m undertaking, I wonder why they didnâ€™t spend 2 seconds pressing the heart, did they even see my photo? Donâ€™t they know I like to get, well a like. It makes me worry. 

Sometimes I would have conversations about how many followers I had on Twitter and Instagram even knowing that most where bots or that I could game ways to grab followers. But sometimes I cared, why has he got more followers when Iâ€™ve been on twitter for years longer. It made me question my content. Should I have been more canny?

So more and more I really appreciate that [micro.blog](http://micro.blog) doesnâ€™t show or support any of this. People can favourite posts but you donâ€™t know, you canâ€™t tell how many people are following you. In fact the delay in extra JavaScript in headings and footers means I canâ€™t install [Matomo](http://analytics.adamprocter.co.uk/) (analytics software thats not Google) and you know what the more I think about it the more I donâ€™t want to now.

When someone mentions me on micro.blog the interaction is so much more meaningful than a little heart, thumbs up or a like. Even a RT / Boosted style posting is not possible and so this is normally a mention with effort, real interaction. 

Thanks [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton) what a good default design decision. 

Wherever I can Iâ€™m turning off stats, likes and such that I donâ€™t need to know. If you want to tell me you liked what I did. Well drop me a line on [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/adamprocter) or start a discussion on [discourse](http://discourse.adamprocter.co.uk).

Had a thought to create [push.adamprocter.co.uk](https://push.adamprocter.co.uk) so people can sign up for silly push notifications from me. Looked at Service Workers, gave up, hahaha the web is much harder to build for these days. Project put in backburner ðŸ”¥ (added emoji for future filter fun ðŸ˜‰ [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton))

    <h1>Instagram makes me anxious ðŸ“· </h1>
  
  <div class="e-content">
  <p>I get anxious when in real life friends donâ€™t like an Instagram photo of mine, especially if it related to work Iâ€™m undertaking, I wonder why they didnâ€™t spend 2 seconds pressing the heart, did they even see my photo? Donâ€™t they know I like to get a like. It makes me worry.</p>

<p>Sometimes I would have conversations about how many followers I had on Twitter and Instagram. Even though I know that many can be bots or that I you can game ways to gain followers. But sometimes I did care, why has he got more followers?  Iâ€™ve been on twitter for years longer. It made me question my content. Should I have been more canny?</p>

<p>So more and more I really appreciate that <a href="http://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> doesnâ€™t show or support any of this. People can favourite posts but you donâ€™t know, you canâ€™t tell how many people are following you. In fact the delay in extra JavaScript in headings and footers means I canâ€™t install <a href="http://analytics.adamprocter.co.uk/">Matomo</a> (analytics software thats not Google) and you know what the more I think about it the more I donâ€™t want to now.</p>

<p>When someone mentions me on micro.blog the interaction is so much more meaningful than a little heart, thumbs up or a like. Even a RT / Boosted style posting is not possible and so this is normally a mention with effort, real interaction.</p>

<p>Thanks <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> what a good default design decision.</p>

<p>Wherever I can Iâ€™m turning off stats, likes and such that I donâ€™t need to know. If you want to tell me you liked what I did. Well drop me a line on <a href="https://micro.blog/adamprocter">micro.blog</a> or start a discussion on <a href="http://discourse.adamprocter.co.uk">discourse</a>.</p>

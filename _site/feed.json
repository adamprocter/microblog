			"content_html": "<p>One of the areas of investigation for my PhD project revolves around spatial user interfaces and connected to this the concept of spatial hypertext. I will be writing in more detail about this however there is little that seems to have advanced in this regard since the mid 2000’s and so I would like to pin down some more current and interesting examples. A key thing is that a spatial interface is not to be confused with a concept map, although there are similarities, a spatial interface is a way to arrange collections of different objects and draw connections between them visually and spatially. I am concerned with a thinking tool to help work out relational information design. Here is a piece on information design I previously <a href=\"http://researchnot.es/7_information_design\">wrote</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Two keys texts are the following;</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Marshall, C.C. &amp; Frank M Shipman, I., 1999.<a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/memex/ACM%5C_HypertextTestbed/papers/37.html\"> Spatial Hypertext: An Alternative to Navigational and Semantic Links</a>. pp.1–5.</li>\n  <li>Bernstein, M., 2013. <a href=\"http://students.ecs.soton.ac.uk/mwra1g13/msc/comp6045/pdfs/Bernstein%20-%20Can%20We%20Talk%20about%20Spatial%20Hypertext.pdf\">Can We Talk about Spatial Hypertext?</a>, pp.1–10.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However what I am keen to gather in the first instance is more examples of spatial interfaces. Here are my starters.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Aquanet</li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://csdl.tamu.edu/~marshall/viki-sidebar.html\">VIKI</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/\">Tinderbox</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.nuclino.com/\">Nuclino</a> </li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://graphcommons.com/\">Graph Commons</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please join the <a href=\"http://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2017/12/26/spatial-ui.html\">discussion here</a> and post any interesting spatial interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, Frode Hegland in his web science PhD is also undertaking some work in this field with what he calls <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcs6umMYg9k\">liquid views</a>. This is an interactive way to work with a text document as a researcher.</p>\n\n",

			"content_html": "<p>The ambition for us (@afcwimbledon) in 2018 has to be survival in League One. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t believe our current position in the league is a management issue at all. I think @neilardley and his team are making good choices and decisions, although I sometimes question his substitution timings as a little predictable, but our current league position is a cash issue. You can link league positions to cash quite quickly which is disheartening but hey that’s another blog post. </p>\n\n<p>Our home end is technically sold out every game and so this limits our income drastically, we know we have a larger fan base and could attract walk in fans, see Wembley gate, and the Spurs gate will no doubt say the same. </p>\n\n<p>So crucial to our further progression is our New Stadium back at Plough lane, recently and finally all agreed to proceed, the Stadium will start by doubling our current capacity and then the potential to double that again. I think we need to survive in League One for our return to Plough Lane, this will provide us a very attractive start for ‘new’ fans and thus the increased revenue will set us up for another group of exciting years! Come on you Dons!</p>\n",

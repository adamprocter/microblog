			"content_html": "<p>This ongoing atttack against university pay specifically against Vice Chancellors is a joke. High quality Education is a must this is what pushes forward a civilisation the fact that there seems to be a miss connection with renumerating those that want to provide it for anyone that wants it, is a joke, the biggest issue is not fees paying VC wages but fees themselves. Higher Education should be available for all no matter your economic background, the ability to pass the entry grades for any university should be within the power of anyone. What‚Äôs wrong is the ability for those that want to attend HE being put off by fees NOT vice chancellor wages. </p>\n",

I think the reasons for learning to code are the same as the reasons for learning to write. When we learn to write, we are learning how to organize, express, and share ideas. And when we learn to code, we are learning how to organize, express, and share ideas in new ways, in a new medium.‚Äù ‚Äî Mitch Resnick</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://dctr.pro/22f\">dctr.pro/22f</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>This ongoing atttack against university pay specifically against Vice Chancellors is unfair. High quality education is a must, this is what pushes forward a civilisation, but the fact that there seems to be a miss connection with renumerating those that lead in Universities, this is a non issue, the biggest issue is not fees paying VC wages but the fees themselves. </p>\n\n<p>Higher Education should be available for all no matter your economic background, the ability to pass the entry requirements for any University should be within the power of anyone. What‚Äôs wrong is the ability for those that want to attend HE being put off by fees NOT Vice Chancellor wages. </p>\n\n<p>Everyone should be fairly renumerated for the work they undertake and Universities not paying living wages should take a hard look at themselves.</p>\n",

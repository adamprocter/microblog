I am a designer-practitioner-researcher at Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton, UK. 

I run the BA Games Design &amp; Art programme, a progressive games course utilising indie style collaborative projects to build new types of games, games for purposes, games as art and highly employable students. 

I am engaged in various research but mainly a practice based PhD investigating and building a new type of open, ethical and design-led digital learning platform for design education. I will happily speak on open and digital teaching practice anywhere, anyhow. 

AFC Wimbledon fan &amp; owner, flat hierarchy, co-operative loving evangelist.
